[here are all the built in callout-types](https://help.obsidian.md/callouts#Supported+types)

>abstract with no title

>[!abstract]-
>foldable callout with no title

>[!question]- What if the problem said...
>1. blabla
>2. blabla
>3. blablabla

>[!question]+
>question callout with no title and using `+` instead of `-` after the callout-type

Here is a list of all the types:
- `info`
- `todo`
- `tip` (aka `hint` and `important`)
- `success` (aka `check` and `done`)
- `question` (aka `help` and `faq`)
- `warning` (aka `caution` and `attention`)
- `failure`(aka `fail` and `missing`)
- `danger` (aka `error`)
- `bug` 
- `example`
- `quote` (aka `cite`)

There is Comp-Sci book written with Obsidian: https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/START+HERE
- Has some good formatting usage that I can adopt (e.g. I learned about callouts)
- used `publish.obsidian.md` to publish the book (could be what i do)
